 * The inner static class Photo was created as a wrapper, because the API expects the actual information about the
 * photo wrapped in another object, called photo. With this approach there was no need to create a custom moshi
 * adapter.

 *      "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
 *      "content": "Base64 encoded image data"
